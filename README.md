# Behaviorial Cloning Project - Report

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This is the report submitted for review.

**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting five files: 
* [model.py](model.py) (script used to create and train the model)
* [drive.py](drive.py) (updated script to drive the car)
* [model.h5](model.h5) (trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (this readme)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)
