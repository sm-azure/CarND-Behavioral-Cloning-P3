Overview
---
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting five files: 
* (model.py)[model.py] (script used to create and train the model)
* drive.py (script to drive the car - feel free to modify this file)
* model.h5 (a trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (either markdown or pdf)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)

This README file describes how to output the video in the "Details About Files In This Directory" section.
