# Behaviorial Cloning Project - Report

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This is the report submitted for review.

**Behavioral Cloning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Files Submitted & Code Quality

#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode
This repository contains starting files for the Behavioral Cloning Project.

The following files are submitted: 
* [model.py](model.py) (script used to create and train the model)
* [drive.py](drive.py) (updated script to drive the car)
* [model.h5](model.h5) (trained Keras model)
* a report writeup file (this readme)
* video.mp4 (a video recording of your vehicle driving autonomously around the track for at least one full lap)

#### 2. Submission includes functional code
Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing 
```sh
python drive.py model.h5
```

#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable
The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.
